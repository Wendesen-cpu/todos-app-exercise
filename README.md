# Todos App with React + TypeScript + Material UI + React Query + Vite

# This small app is a showcase of react-typescript app.

I used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos fake api to fetch list of todos and render list on a react app.

I also implemented a filtering option using a sting searchTerm, boolean option of completed or not and a userId to filter todos.
